accessibility\application-considerations.md:To indicate the primary language, use the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element.

routing\defining-your-routes.md:- The top-level index route is analogous to `index.html`. For example, when someone visits `https://some-ember-app.com`, the contents of the `template/index.hbs` file will be rendered. There is no need to add an entry `this.route('index', { path: '/' });` in `app/router.js` file. The `index` route is implicitly included in order to help reduce verbose declarations in the `app/router.js`. The `app/router.js` file could be empty, and the `index` would still be shown:
testing\index.md:Lastly, if you are already running a local development server (through `ember server`), you can visit the `/tests` URI. This will render the `tests/index.html` template.
